# Changelog

All notable changes to BIOS Implant are documented in this file.

## 1.0.21 - 2026-08-19

The public marketplace moved to `8hats/marketplace`; this repository is retired and about to be
archived. A machine that installed from `8hats/plugins` keeps fetching this copy, so this release
is the last thing it will ever receive — and it exists only to say so.

- New `SessionStart` hook `scripts/old-marketplace-notice.mjs`: if the local registry (or
  `extraKnownMarketplaces`) still carries a marketplace sourced at `8hats/plugins`, it asks the
  owner to re-add from `8hats/marketplace` and reinstall the plugin. It reads two files, writes
  nothing, always exits 0, and goes silent by itself once the machine has migrated
- The hook recognises the hijack case separately: when the affected key is `8hats-plugins` — the
  internal team marketplace's own name, which `add 8hats/plugins` retargets in place — it tells
  the owner to restore `8hats/8hats-plugins` and explicitly NOT to remove the entry, because
  removing it uninstalls every team plugin that came from it
- The marketplace and plugin descriptions, and the plugin's display name, now carry the move in
  plain sight for anyone who opens the plugin browser

## 1.0.20 - 2026-08-11

Everything here traces to the MEOW-20 onboarding transcript (2026-08-11).

- `local_activate` absorbs transient network failures itself: three attempts with 300/900ms
  backoff for the setup fetch and the activation request, and the error message now names the
  concrete cause (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOTFOUND`, …) and the attempt count. MEOW-20's first
  activation died on one hiccup and surfaced a scary failure whose whole remedy was "run it
  again 24 seconds later"
- An activation TIMEOUT is deliberately NOT auto-retried and gets its own code
  (`ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT`, `link_spent: null`): the request may have reached the registry with
  only the response lost, and a blind resend of a one-use capability reads back as "spent",
  turning a successful activation into a reported failure. The message routes the operator
  through a state check instead. `BIOS_IMPLANT_ACTIVATION_TIMEOUT_MS` makes the contract
  testable
- Remote authorization instructions now name the host plugin UI as THE action — Claude Code:
  `/plugin` → Installed → bios-implant → server `implant` → Authenticate; Claude Desktop: the
  plugin browser's Authorize — in boot (where an unauthorized `bios_load` surfaces) and in
  connect's REMOTE-AUTH. Both skills ban calling the harness-injected `authenticate` tool and
  relaying its raw `…/auth?…` URL into chat: that URL's PKCE challenge and localhost callback
  belong to the one flow that minted it, and MEOW-20's owner authorized through `/plugin`,
  which minted its own client and port — the pasted URL was already a challenge that could
  never complete

## 1.0.19 - 2026-08-11

Everything in this release traces to one onboarding (agent `TVP_TEST_2-paired-2026-08`, 2026-08-10) that activated cleanly and never booted.

- Hold agent ids and labels to the alphabet bios-server actually serves — Latin letters, digits, hyphen, 64 chars max. The wider local rule bound ids the server 422s on every `bios_load`, after the one-use link was spent. Tool schemas derive from one shared constant; cross-repo parity tests pin byte-identity with app-v2's creation gate and behavioural identity with bios-server's slug
- Refuse a setup document naming an unservable agent id as `AGENT_ID_UNSERVABLE` BEFORE the activation request — the link stays unspent and the message names the remedy (recreate the agent), instead of activating into a permanently dead binding
- `local_activate` now finishes the job: it chains the folder binding for the current workspace root and reports `registry_bound` and `folder_bound` apart. The registry's bare `bound: true` had taught callers to stop with the workspace unbound and nothing left to retry
- Skills carry `allowed-tools`, so a first-run activation is not denied by the harness permission classifier before the owner ever sees a prompt
- connect gains the two missing legs: REMOTE-AUTH (native OAuth first; the `script -q /dev/null claude mcp login …` recovery for no-TTY surfaces) and a literal RESTART step — the session tool registry is fixed at start, so mid-session authorization never surfaces `bios_load` in the running session
- doctor and boot read remote codes as vocabulary: `bad_shape` = unservable id (never auth — do not re-login), `unauthorized` = token vs ownership, `not_found` = calm waiting state; doctor also names the false signal where `claude mcp list` prints `connection timed out after 30000ms` for a server that is really answering 401

- boot passes the bound `agent_id` to `wm_load` — the authenticated selector that resolves an owner with several agents, for whom the parameterless worldmodel path answers a deterministic `unauthorized`

Server-side halves released alongside, outside this package: bios-server names every 422's reason in `x-bios-error`; implant-mcp forwards it as `bad_shape: <reason>` and carries the `agent_id` selector on every wm tool; worldmodel verifies the selector against the token's subject.

## 1.0.18 - 2026-08-11

- Boot status now follows whether the agent HAS the knowledge its BIOS names, not whether `wm_load` answered: a BIOS that carries its own knowledge reaches `LOADED` without the worldmodel service, instead of reporting itself degraded while holding a complete firmware
- Forbid credential archaeology during boot — no keychain reads, no token or OAuth config files; report the refusal and the recovery action instead. An opaque `unauthorized` had sent a booted agent reading the OS keychain for the host's OAuth credentials
- Pin both rules in the bootstrap contract tests

## 1.0.17 - 2026-08-10

- Report one version everywhere: the plugin manifest, the package manifest, and the runtime constant were 1.0.16 / 1.0.15 / 1.0.15, so the companion announced itself over MCP as `implant-local 1.0.15` while the host showed 1.0.16
- Pin the three version sources against each other in the bootstrap contract tests, so a release that bumps only the plugin manifest fails instead of shipping
- No behaviour change: `dist/local-mcp.mjs` is a shim over `src/`, so the runtime picks the corrected constant up without a build step

Server-side fixes released the same day, outside this package: the remote MCP now returns the BIOS body in the structured payload instead of only in the text block, which is what made `bios_load` look like it returned an empty body (`8hats/implant-mcp` PR #5, `8hats/bios-server` PR #10).

## 1.0.16 - 2026-08-10

- Retire the npm channel from every install surface: README, INSTALL.md, SETUP.md, and the install skill teach only the 8hats/plugins marketplace
- Point repair and update guidance at the host's own plugin machinery instead of the retired npx installer
- Pin the marketplace-only contract in the bootstrap tests, with a guard against any runnable npx command returning

## 1.0.15 - 2026-08-10

## 1.0.2 - 2026-08-03

- Added the public Local Cowork bootstrap at `https://app.agents.university/bios-implant/SETUP.md` so an unauthenticated agent can fetch one URL before BIOS authorization exists
- Moved the npm README Local Cowork handoff to lead with that absolute public setup URL, with the terminal install flow kept as fallback

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-03
